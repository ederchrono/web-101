# Wizeline MDX-deck template

[MDX-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) uses Markdown files and React to generate slides for your presentations.

The purpose of this repo is for you to have a starter template with some useful components and a Wizeline theme.

## Slides as code

Since MDX-deck uses markdown files to make the slides, you can delete the `.git` folder and move the files inside any other repo to start tracking it and have your slides along your project.

This can help a lot to on-board new people or save demo presentations.

## How to use?

- installation

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

- run the slides

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```
