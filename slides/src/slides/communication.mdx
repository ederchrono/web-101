## Animation `>` _type_ & color

<Notes>but we are not giving the importance it requires</Notes>

---

### Animations are `not` the icing in the cake

We need to plan them from the beginning

---

![](./slides/images/wireframes.png)

<Notes>When we start a project, we create wireframes to communicate composition</Notes>

---

export default BlankTemplate

![](./slides/images/zeplin.png)

<Notes>
and we have gone as far as having design tools that generate the code for the styles of a
page

but there's a gap when it comes to communicate animations

</Notes>

---

# Basic terminology

### Communication is key

<Notes>
It doesn't matter if you are a ux designer, sw engineer or project manager,

We need a way to be able to express the way we want an animation to work.

Saying "I want this button to disappear after clicked" is like telling
someone to make a menu pretty or a button important, it is really ambiguous

</Notes>

## Transition

#### Our building block

<Notes>A transition is our main tool to create animations.</Notes>

---

### An animation can be made of `one` or `more` transitions

<Notes>
Transition is not equal to animation, an animation can be made from just one transition but it could also be a group of transitions.

Imagine that animation is a living being and a transition is a cell

There are organisms that can be made of only one cell or have a lot of cells

And transition like a cell has many parts

</Notes>

<Notes>... but don't worry there are less parts in a transition than in a cell</Notes>

---

## A transition is made of...

- Start state
- End state
- Time
- Delay
- Easing

<Notes>I'll explain them but first let's look at an example</Notes>

---

export default BlankTemplate

<Codepen url="https://codepen.io/ederdiaz/pen/gNKKVY" />

<Notes>let's break it down into it's elements</Notes>

---

export default BlankTemplate

![](./slides/images/transition.png)

<Notes>
The start state defines the properties of the object at the beginning of the transition

Similarly the end state sets the way they should end

there are a lot of properties in an object but we are just mentioning the ones we wantto change

delay indicates how much time the transition should take to start

and the time defines how long should it take for the properties to change.

most of this is almost self explanatory except for the easing

</Notes>

---

## Easing

### The style of your transition

---

## Also called `easing function`,

### defines the `progress` of the transition through `time`

---

export default BlankTemplate

![](./slides/images/functions.png)

<Notes>
The function works with 2 axis, in this case the horizontal is the time of the transition,
and the vertical one is the progress or how much the properties of the object are changing

if you still dont get it don't worry, we are going to use animations to understand them better

</Notes>

---

export default BlankTemplate

![](./slides/images/linear.gif)

<Notes>
First the simplest one, linear

as it name implies as the time passes the change of the properties will be linear,
it will keep the same speed with no acceleration

you can see the green circle constantly going up

the problem with linear is that it is the less natural easing function, when you
animate objects with it things look robotic.

that could be good if you are animating an airplane or a robot that needs to look like that,
but for most cases you'll want to avoid this easing

</Notes>

![](./slides/images/ease-in.gif)
![](./slides/images/ease-out.gif)
![](./slides/images/ease-in-out.gif)

<Notes>
Now we have these 3 functions, ease in, ease out and ease in out

Ease in starts really slow and then starts accelerating until it gets to the end

Ease out is the oposite, it starts moving quickly and then loses it's speed until it stops

finally ease in out is a combination of the other two, it starts slow,
then accelerates at the middle and loses speed at the end

these 3 easings are the most common ones, you'll be using them most of the times
because the look more natural.

but they are not the only easings that exist, actually like functions, there's
and infinite number of easings that you can create and use

</Notes>

![](./slides/images/elastic.gif)
![](./slides/images/bounce.gif)

<Notes>
For example elastic, which goes beyond the end state and gets back and forth
like a rubber band until it settles

and bounce, that gets to the end state but bounces back a couple of times before finishing

</Notes>

<Notes>now with that knowledge we can start making some...</Notes>

### Motion Specs

```
start state
  - x:0
  - y:0
  - scale:1

end state
  - x:300
  - y:300
  - scale:2
time: 3
delay: 2
ease: EaseIn
```

<Notes>
These specifications will help us to communicate with others how an animation should be

they can be as simple as text like this one, or you can get fancy and use a graphic
tool like sketch and use a template like this...
