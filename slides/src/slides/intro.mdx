### Last year I bought a car...

## Which one do you think I got?

<Appear>
  <p>It was the Mazda...</p>
  <p>... why?</p>
  <p>Because the VW was a 2013 model</p>

<Notes>
so last year I sold my old car to buy a new one, which one do you think I got?

- wait for answers...

I bought the Mazda

why?

I agree with you, the animated site looked way better

but if I had bought the VW it would have been a 2013 model

Yeah, I made that site more than 6 years ago

Why did we stop making animations?

There are a couple of reasons I can think of...

Flash is dead...

it basically died when Apple made the iPhone and said
"We are not going to support Flash, because it drains our betteries"

But actually it was because they wanted us to pay
for games in their AppStore, instead of playing free games in the browser.

Another reason might have been the rise of bootstrap

Making almost any site on the earth look exactly the same,

That was the price to pay for making sites more intuitive, develop them faster
and make them work on all devices.

but there's a pattern I noticed, which is...

### Hype Cycle

<Notes>

It starts with a trigger

in this case flash and its vector graphics and better internet speeds
which let us download quickly graphic intensive sites

The peak was when flash was king, and every site had their infamous intro,
and if you as a user were lucky it would have a skip button.

This is when the techonology is overused and then that leads to dissapointment

Smart phones gained popularity and animations started to get in the way more than helping the user,
mostly because they didn't have the hadware we have right now.

We are in the slope of enlightenment,
were we can learn from our past mistakes and start using the technology correctly.
