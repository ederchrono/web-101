## Why animation is important?

<Notes>
We are used to things moving

In nature there are no static things (animals, clouds, even plants move)

It's our nature, if we see something moving we either inspect it or run

export default BlankTemplate

<Codepen title="ðŸ‘€" url="https://codepen.io/ederdiaz/pen/orGryd" />

<Notes>
Don't blink, when I click this, 4 buttons will appear, tell me which one gets your attention

Not even a heavy typography or the color red got your eye as much as that moving button.

The grey color in the animated button makes it look like it is disabled, but
that doesn't matter because it is moving and our brain tells us that we should put
attention to it
