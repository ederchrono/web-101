## Tool or weapon?

<Notes>
Like a knife, animation can be used for good and for bad, 
we should use UI animations in a meaningful way.

A carelessly designed animation can be more a distraction or cause
the opposite effect we want.

I'm now going to show you some examples where animation can become a great tool

### Convey emotions

<Notes>
if an image is worth thousands of words, imagine how many words is an animation

Animation can be used to get to people's feelings, if you don't think so,
ask anyone how they felt after seeing pixar's movie Coco

I think all of us have seen something like this in the preferences of any website that
requires you to login.

Sometimes we give it a chance and check it, but most of the times
we uncheck it and never come back.

Now this toggle control has the same functionality that the previous one, but this one
rewards you when you activate it.

Somehow it gives you the feeling that they appreciate
that you accept to be in their mailing list. And if you deactivate it, you might even
regret it because it looks so sad

### Orienting the user

<Notes>
  Animation can help users to create mental models and reduce any unnecessary cognitive
  load

<Notes>
in this example we can see an Image with some text, and also there's button

when I click it this happens...

your brain right now is trying really hard to understand what changed

what happens if we add animation to this same example?

<Notes>
  you can quickly tell what happened, your brain didn't have to struggle figuring out what
  changed

### Improve the waiting tolerance

<IframeLoader title="Loader example" url="https://giphy.com/embed/XcLlVDeT5BBvDxWQjn" />

<Notes>
this is a video of me uploading a profile image to linkedIn

at first I didn't even notice the generic loader in the middle of the image,
it is really badly positioned and I felt it took a lot of time to load.

</Notes>

<Codepen url="https://codepen.io/ederdiaz/pen/GxQvNW" />

<Notes>
now when I click this button I immediately see something happening, the transformation
of the button gives me feedback,

and even though it can take longer than uploading an image, 
it didn't feel that long

It's like when you start watching a tv show and suddenly it is 5am in a monday morning
because you just saw 3 seasons in a row

So next time instead of working for weeks, months or years trying to optimize
loading times to keep your users engaged, you can invest a couple of hours
in making a good (non generic) animated loader that will have the same effect.
